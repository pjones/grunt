# This file should contain hashes whose keys are launchd labels and
# whose values are a hash that contains keys that will be turned into
# launchd configuration options.  You should review the man page for
# launchd.plist since it contains a list of all possible configuration
# options for a launchd daemon or agent.
#
# This file is preprocessed by ERB.
#
# Mandatory keys for each agent/daemon:
#
#   Type: Must be either Agent or Daemon.  Used to tell ymlaunch where
#         to place the generated plist file.  This key will not be
#         translated into the plist file.
#
#  UserName: Used by ymlaunch when Type is Agent to know which user's
#            launch agents directory to place plist files into.
